# APCSMineSweeper
This version of Minesweeper is designed as a lab for AP Computer Science A students to work on multidimensional arrays. The Minesweeper application does not function properly and it the task of the students to complete the program.

# Students
Everything you need is in the toStudents directory. Your task is to complete the following methods in MyGrid.java to make MineSweeper function properly
- void initializeHints()
...This method generates the numbers that tell the player how many mines are around a square
- boolean checkDead(int r, int c)
...This method returns true if the player clicks a mine
- boolean checkWin()
...This method returns true when all the squares have been clicked except the squares containing bombs
- void updateGrid(int r, int c)
... This method shows the number beneath the square. If the square is zero, the method will open all the adjacent squares that are not mines. The method will clear an area of zeros to enable faster play.

You can refer to Minesweeper.fodt for more information.
Javadocs for TheGrid class is available in the javadoc folde

# Teachers
The source for of the program is available under the src directory. The students don't need to look at the source of the other three classes. But you can show them after the lab for learning purposes.
